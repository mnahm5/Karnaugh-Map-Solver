Karnaugh Map Solver
===================

This program uses the Quine-McCluskey Method to solve Karnaugh Maps (a common math problem for electrical engineers). Please feel free you use the code in your own projects and improve upon it if possible. Hope you like it.

Then you have to input the values into the input boxes and click on the 'Calculate' button. Then the solution will be calculated and displayed above the buttons as shown below.

When the 'Enter Truth Table' button is clicked a dialouge box appears. This is shown in the figure below.

To input values into a truth table first you have to first input the size of the truth table and then clicking the 'Create Truth Table' button. For example entering 3 will give the result shown in the figure below.

The default values in the truth table is 0. You change it to 1 or X (i.e. don't care) using the dropdown menu. You then have to choose between using the 'Product of Sums Notation' or the 'Sum of Products Notation'. Selecting the 'Get Min Terms' radio button will make the program calulcate using the 'Sum of Products Notation'. The solution will be calculated after you click on the 'Calculate' button. The solution will be provided below the truth table as shown below.
